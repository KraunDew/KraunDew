## About Me
I am 15 years old. I speack 2 languajes Spanish and English I'm Chilean, but just because I am 15 years old does not mean that I do not know how to program, I have been in contact with programming since I was 10 years old. And with this I have always thought that the only limits there are are the ones you set for yourself.

> # Why I do program?
> I program because it has always caught my attention, and I also thought it would be easy.
